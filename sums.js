// Create a function named sums that accepts a number and returns its partitions.

// A partition is a group of numbers, where the sum of the partition is equal to the number argument.
// Duplicate partitions are not allowed. [1, 2] and [2, 1] are considered duplicates. The array of partitions must be sorted.
